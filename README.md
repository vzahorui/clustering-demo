# Clustering-demo
This is an app which allows creating a 2-dimensional datasets and testing various clustering algorithms on it.

You can:
  * Generate Datasets:
    - Create clusters of different shapes (circle, ellipse, rectangle) at specified locations.
    - Add individual data points for more complex scenarios.
    - Remove unwanted points for data refinement.
  * Clustering Exploration:
    - Select from a range of clustering algorithms: K-means, Agglomerative, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, etc.
    - Adjust hyperparameters relevant to the chosen algorithm (e.g., k for K-Means, number of clusters).
    - Visualize the clustering results with distinct colors assigned to each cluster.
    - Identify outliers (if the algorithm supports it), marked in dark gray for easy recognition.
    - Observe how hyperparameter changes affect the clustering outcome.
